                           on one dimension of population development, such as the mortality rates. However, such a one-
                           dimensional representation has a number of limitations. One is that mortality is particularly high
                           at highest ages. If for the mortality rates a color scheme is chosen in which higher mortality is
                           indicated by a more saturated or more prominent color (e.g., red), this part of the Lexis surface
                           becomes visually very dominant. However, at very high ages frequently only few members of
                           the initially born cohorts are still alive, so that this part of the Lexis plot has little relevance for
