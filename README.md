## Reproduction

This is the code to reproduce the plots in the paper 'Exploring the Demographic History of Populations with Enhanced Lexis Surfaces' from Jorge Cimentada and Sebastian Kl√ºsener, submitted to Demographic Research.

### Running the Shiny app

This repository implements an R Shiny application to visualize enhanced lexis plots. To launch the Shiny app only a few steps are needed:

1) Register at the [Human Mortality Database website](https://www.mortality.org/mp/auth.pl).
2) Save your credentials in a new file `shiny/id.txt` where the first line is your email and the second line is your password
1) Open the file `run_app_here.R`
2) Install all the packages in the start of the R script.
3) Run the script

This should open up the application.

### Structure of the app

- The main file is `run_app_here.R`, which loads the packages, sets the menu options for the application and starts the Shiny app.

- The file `shiny/server.R` is the actual workhorse that downloads population/mortality data, cleans the datasets, performes scaling and produces the plot.

- The file `shiny/ui.R` implements the user interface of the application and includes code to generate the options menu, background colors, among other things.

- The R files in `shiny/aux_scripts/` are scripts that performing specific tasks such as cleaning the data, producing plots, among other things. These are all called from `shiny/server.R` so no need to touch these interactively. Below is a brief description of each file
  + `shiny/aux_scripts/create_plot.R` creates a function that generates the plot
  + `shiny/aux_scripts/define_color_width.R` generates a continuous color and width scale proportional to the mortality and population estimates respectively.
  + `shiny/aux_scripts/load_cmx.R` loads mortality data from the Human Mortality Data Base
  + `shiny/aux_scripts/load_pop.R` loads population data from the Human Mortality Data Base
  + `shiny/aux_scripts/prepare_data.R` performs data cleaning for the mortality and population datasets
  
- The folders `shiny/data/` contains a small `.csv` file with HMD country names to make a conversion between long country names and short country names used in the Human Mortality Database.

- The folder `shiny/www` contains images used in the Shiny app.

- The file `todo.txt` contains bugs that are found along the way the will be fixed in the future.

### Steps to reproduce paper

To reproduce the plots in the paper 'Exploring the Demographic History of Populations with Enhanced Lexis Surfaces', follow the steps below:

1) Load the Shiny app by following the first section in this document.

2) Steps to reproduce figure 1:
  + Choose Sweden in option 'Select country'
  + Select background color as 'White'
  + Click on 'Create plot'

3) Steps to reproduce figure 2:
  + Choose Sweden in option 'Select country'
  + Select background color as 'White'
  + Set option 'Type of line width' to 'Standardize cohort by itself'
  + Click on 'Create plot'

4) Steps to reproduce figure 3:
  + Choose France in option 'Select country'
  + Select background color as 'White'
  + Set option 'Type of line width' to 'Classic Lexis Surface'
  + Click on 'Create plot'
  
5) Steps to reproduce figure 4a:
  + Choose France in option 'Select country'
  + Select background color as 'White'
  + Set option 'Type of line width' to 'Standardize cohort by itself'
  + Click on 'Create plot'
  
5) Steps to reproduce figure 4b:
  + Choose France in option 'Select country'
  + Select background color as 'White'
  + Set option 'Type of line width' to 'Standardize relative to cohort'
  + Set option 'Line width relative to which year' to 1960
  + Click on 'Create plot'
  
6) Steps to reproduce figure 5:
  + Choose USA in option 'Select country'
  + Select background color as 'White'
  + Set 'Select indicator' to 'First order differences in cohort mortality rates'
  + Set option 'Type of line width' to 'Classic Lexis Surface'
  + Click on 'Create plot'

7) Steps to reproduce figure 6:
  + Choose USA in option 'Select country'
  + Select background color as 'White'
  + Set 'Select indicator' to 'First order differences in cohort mortality rates'
  + Set option 'Type of line width' to 'Standardize relative to cohort'
  + Set option 'Line width relative to which year' to 1960
