## Reproduction

This is the code to reproduce the plots in the paper 'Exploring the Demographic History of Populations with Enhanced Lexis Surfaces' from Jorge Cimentada and Sebastian Kl√ºsener, submitted to Demographic Research.

You can view the Shiny application from the paper [here](https://cimentadaj.shinyapps.io/enhanced_lexis_plot/).

### Running the Shiny app

This repository implements a R Shiny application to visualize enhanced lexis plots. To launch the Shiny app only a few steps are needed:

1) Register at the [Human Mortality Database website](https://www.mortality.org/mp/auth.pl).
2) Save your credentials in a new file `id.txt` in the root of the repository where the first line is your email and the second line is your password
3) Open the file `global.R` and install all the packages in the start of the R script.
4) Run `shiny::runApp()` in R inside the main folder of the repository.

This should open up the application.

### Structure of the app

- The 'preface' file is `global.R` which loads the packages and sets the menu options for the application.

- The file `server.R` is the actual workhorse that downloads population/mortality data, cleans the datasets, performs scaling and produces the plot.

- The file `ui.R` implements the user interface of the application and includes code to generate the options menu, background colors, among other things.

- The R files in `aux_scripts/` are scripts that perform specific tasks such as cleaning the data, producing plots, among other things. These are all called from `server.R` so no need to touch these interactively. Below is a brief description of each file
  + `aux_scripts/create_plot.R` creates a function that generates the plot
  + `aux_scripts/define_color_width.R` generates a continuous color and width scale proportional to the mortality and population estimates respectively.
  + `aux_scripts/load_cmx.R` loads mortality data from the Human Mortality Data Base
  + `aux_scripts/load_pop.R` loads population data from the Human Mortality Data Base
  + `aux_scripts/prepare_data.R` performs data cleaning for the mortality and population datasets
  
- The folder `data/` contains a small `.csv` file with HMD country names to make a conversion between long country names and short country names used in the Human Mortality Database.

- The folder `www/` contains images used in the Shiny app.

- The file `todo.txt` contains bugs/new features that are found along the way the will be fixed/added in the future.

### Steps to reproduce paper

To reproduce the plots in the paper 'Exploring the Demographic History of Populations with Enhanced Lexis Surfaces', follow the steps below:

1) Load the Shiny app by following the first section in this document (or just look at deployed application [here](https://cimentadaj.shinyapps.io/enhanced_lexis_plot/)).

2) Steps to reproduce figure 1:
  + Choose Sweden in option 'Select country'
  + Select background color as 'White'
  + Click on 'Create plot'

3) Steps to reproduce figure 2:
  + Choose Sweden in option 'Select country'
  + Select background color as 'White'
  + Set option 'Type of line width' to 'Standardize cohort by itself'
  + Click on 'Create plot'

4) Steps to reproduce figure 3:
  + Choose France in option 'Select country'
  + Select background color as 'White'
  + Set option 'Type of line width' to 'Classic Lexis Surface'
  + Click on 'Create plot'
  
5) Steps to reproduce figure 4a:
  + Choose France in option 'Select country'
  + Select background color as 'White'
  + Set option 'Type of line width' to 'Standardize cohort by itself'
  + Click on 'Create plot'
  
5) Steps to reproduce figure 4b:
  + Choose France in option 'Select country'
  + Select background color as 'White'
  + Set option 'Type of line width' to 'Standardize relative to cohort'
  + Set option 'Line width relative to which year' to 1960
  + Click on 'Create plot'
  
6) Steps to reproduce figure 5:
  + Choose USA in option 'Select country'
  + Select background color as 'White'
  + Set 'Select indicator' to 'First order differences in cohort mortality rates'
  + Set option 'Type of line width' to 'Classic Lexis Surface'
  + Click on 'Create plot'

7) Steps to reproduce figure 6:
  + Choose USA in option 'Select country'
  + Select background color as 'White'
  + Set 'Select indicator' to 'First order differences in cohort mortality rates'
  + Set option 'Type of line width' to 'Standardize relative to cohort'
  + Set option 'Line width relative to which year' to 1960
  + Click on 'Create plot'
